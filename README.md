# TS-ELECTIONFETCH Ruby Script
Simple ruby script to parse the election data from an endpoint and output the desired information.
Currently this is only mapped for the state of Telangana,but it should be easy to refactor in the top level array S29 means Telangana state as it is the 29th state of India,likewise other available states can also be identified
For now the API endpoint which I'm using is an official GoI website but it doesn't seem to be documented anywhere.
this script is very lackluster,i didn't care much as the election result are declared already so not much use here other than learning more about parsing and interaction with APIs.
